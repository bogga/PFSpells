# PFSpells

## What it does
This app takes a character name (this name becomes the name of the file - call it what you like) and a list of spell names. It queries d20pfsrd for these spell names and returns the spell details to an HTML file in a list.

Think of every time you've come across a wizard NPC who has 30 spells, some of which you barely know. Now you can generate her entire spellbook and save it to a single, easily-read file for future reference!
